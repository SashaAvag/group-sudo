1.Verify whether dhclient is running.
	ps fax | grep dhclient

2.Display your current ip address(es).
	/sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet '
		
3.Display the configuration file where this ip address is defined.
	sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

4. Follow the nic configuration in the book to change your ip address from dhcp client  to fixed. Keep the same ip address  to avoid conflicts!
	sudo ifdown lo	
	sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
		address 127.0.0.1
	sudo ifup lo

6. Verify that you have a gateway.
	route -n

7. Verify that you can connect to the gateway, that it is alive.
	ping -c2 127.0.0.1

8. Change the last two digits of your mac address.
	ifconfig
	sudo ifconfig enp0s7 hw ether 50:e5:49:94:40:b4

9. Which ports are used by http, pop3, ssh, telnet, nntp and ftp ?
	grep ^'http' /etc/services 
	grep ^'https' /etc/services 
 	grep ^'pop3' /etc/services 
	grep ^'ssh' /etc/services 
	grep ^'telnet' /etc/services 
	grep ^'nntp' /etc/services 
	grep ^'ftp' /etc/services 

10. Explain why e-mail and websites are sent over tcp  and not udp.
	Because tcp is reliable and udp is not.

11. Display the hostname  of your computer.
	hostname

12. Which ip-addresses did your computer recently have contact with ?
	arp -a
	

                          ___5.11. practice: ssh___

1. Install sshd on the server
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server

2. Verify in the ssh configuration files that only protocol version 2 is allowed.
	grep Protocol /etc/ssh/ssh*_config

3. Use ssh to log on to the server, show your current directory and then exit the server.
	ssh avagyan@192.168.0.102
	exit

4. Use scp to copy a file from your computer to the server.
	scp localfile user@server:~

5. Use scp to copy a file from the server to your computer.
	scp user@server:~/serverfile .

6. (optional, only works when you have a graphical install of Linux) Install the xeyes package
on the server and use ssh to run xeyes on the server, but display it on your client.
	sudo apt-get install xeyes
	ssh -X avagyan@192.168.0.102 xeyes

7. Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between
you and your neighbour. (or between your client and your server)
	

8.Verify that the permissions on the server key files are correct; world readable for the public
keys and only root access for the private keys.
	ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

9. Verify that the ssh-agent is running.
	ps fax | grep ssh-agent

10. (optional) Protect your keypair with a passphrase, then add this key to the ssh-agent
and test your passwordless ssh to the server.
	ssh-keygen
	ssh-agent
	ssh-add (When run without arguments, it adds the files  ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and
     	~/.ssh/identity_)
